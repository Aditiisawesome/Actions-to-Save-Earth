            <p id="text1">My thoughts of the responsibilities that will be stored throughout this website are remarkably easy. They help make a small idea become a great impact on how we effect the Earth to this day. The website will share the easy techniques and etiquette of these action and what the main sulotion of each individual action leads to and prevents from.Also sharing day to day news of the usage of those actions. And the way schools and communities here and there are helping solve these problems. All of which explained above will be throughout explained more in my website.Now here are some of my opinions of these actions and what will happen if they are not as used as often as needed.</p>
<p>The 3R's Recycle,Reuse,and Reduce, if these actions are not taken easily world dumps will over proceed and pollution,food and trash waste, and air toxins or air pollution.
If you dont reuse materials or dont have a plan recycle materials so they can be made into many more greater things instead of ways to make Earth worse every day. Dumps also cause wild life and others property to be taken over for some disgusting and filthy material dump just so humanity can dispose all its problems for others and nature to take care of. And finally one of the worsest endings of all is animals eating them   in thought of food which can tear down their life awareness throughout time causing your actions to disrupt the food web. More info will be pasted in the following paragraphs about these actions.</p>
<p class="trial1">Renewable Energy is a a good source of reusable energy. It helps prevent the use of fossil fuel causing are pollution and low findings of Fossil Fuels as well. This also causes good shaping for land managment and fuel for plants to produce properly giving a healthy and proper managment of time and life. Also Renewable Energy doesnt cause as much of time and can be reused everytime making the tools easy to find,reproduce,and function the way you want them to.</p>
<p>And finally Vertical Farming. Vertical Farming is a way that plants are put in a vertacil position to keep more space this helps people fix the amount of produce in a low amount of land or space. This also helps them save time and money and estimate what plants will be grown before the other according to how there placed.This also helps them vary the plants from heights,weigth,and blooming time. These also help companies spend a lower amount of time finding new space and more time to list buyers to quick responses for buying their products. And finally because of thier ability to save space for wildlife to bloom and nature to still have its space, keeping each others wantings and need to their own time and place.</p>
<p id="text2">This concludes my thoughts of each action and the things that would happen without them or what the actions could prevent. Now we will focus on the extra details of how they function,what they are most likely meaning do to their title,and a little thoughts from these paragraphs. This will be resumed throughout each small paragraph parted throughout the whole website. I hope you enjoy and be free to make a website of your one thoughts about this or any of the topics or actions included in it.
<br>
<p>I hope you enjoyed my opinions and that you will enjoy the rest of the website</p>

<div>Renewable Energy can be used for Elecricity,Farming Managment,Function Water,etc. This will help well needed things in a human's life be less of a darker impact to the Earth and the Animals living on it. And finally because the use of Renewable Energy will help provide more and more necisities without bieng acausing trouble.<div>
<br>
<div>Renewable Energy sources are mainly known as Solar,Water,Wind, and Thermal. These sources are useful by getting materials such as Solar Panels or Wind-Mills. And finally these sources all interact the safest way with Earth and peoples ideas and add a latch of help to make them even better.<div>
<br>
<div>Vertical Farming is how you can make small bunkers for plants to grow so you have a greater amout of space for goods to be sold throughout the fruit and veggie merchandise. This means that companies get to buy small pieces of land and still have an opportunity of selling goods without any delays due to growth time and space intake.<div>
<br>
<div>Vertical Farming helps people with low managment for bieng more land,easier for companies to expand land and still have enough money. And help people understand when specific goods are available and what plants size and compasity it takes to mantain plants with low expectations to willing know whats happening to there land since their low but fair amount of land.<div>

<h2>This Section Shares the What will happen when these Actions are taken and what will happen if they are not taken.</h2>
<h3 id="changecolor">What will happen when all these actions are taken care of?</h3>
<ol>
<li>If vertical farming is doing what its doing people will buy less land but still have enough good to give off to consumers. And there will still be enough room for wildlife to do wonderful things while mantaining good relations with the amount of space.</li>
<br>
<li>If Renewable Energy is doing what its suppost to do people will use less fossil fuels making air pollution and more time for fossil fuels and other non-renewable material produce more and later on we might not even need them.</li>
<br>
<li>If the 3Rs is doing what its suppost to do people will produce less polutions to wildlife and spend more time working up with creativity.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What will happen if these actions are not taking care of?</h3>
<ul>
<li>If vertical farming doesnt go the way it should people will go spend all their money without knowing the great things that they could accomplish with Vertical Farming. And wont have enough time to sell goods to open consumers.</li>
<br>
<li>If Renewable Energy doesnt go the way it should people would over use non-renewable material and not have any idea off what to do without it so thry later on have to fufilly go through tough times just to figure out the truth of using renewable energy.</li>
<br>
<li>If the 3Rs dont go the way it should people would over pollute water,air,etc. And this will end up going over man kind and it would become harder and harder to live to the choice until then they will finally understand the necisities of the 3Rs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions to ask and there Answers:</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>What do you mean specifically about pollution?</th>
<th>Why did you want to create this website?</th>
<th>How do you think we should respond to this info?</th>
<th>Why do you want to elaborate on these specific actions?</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>I am saying that these actions can really stop major impacts all of these pretty much leading up to pollution or also known as a mess most likely meant as A pile of junk surviving and over growing to the matter of making something dirty or unclean.</td>
<td>Because I wanted to share my wanting for people to keep the Earth safe and keep in mind that everyday is Earth day so we should do the best we can. And because many people arent really cautious.
</td>
<td>Try creating a website or share your thoughts about how to save the Earth or try out some fun ways to help the earth and share your creativity for others to learn.And finally try to teach yourself new facts and info to make you and the world a better place.</td>
<td>Because these are every day things Ive seen people do but still dont see many people putting an effort to it so I thought it was time for people to know some background details of these actions and what they could prevent even more to make them think to share them with others and let more to know to take these actions and even better ones later on.</td>
